  Theorem: A nonempty collection of natural numbers has a least member.
  Proof: We prove by strong induction on b that if b is a member, the
  collection has a least member. Strong induction allows us to assume
  the assertion for every natural number smaller than b.

  If some member a is smaller than b, the induction hypothesis at a
  gives a least member. If no member is smaller than b, then b itself
  is least. Finally, nonemptiness supplies a member to start with. QED

theorem division_exists (m n : Nat) (hn : 0 < n) :
    ∃ q r : Int, (m : Int) = (n : Int) * q + r ∧ 0 ≤ r ∧ r < (n : Int) := by
  /-
  Theorem: For a natural number m and a positive natural number n,
  there are integers q and r with m = n * q + r and 0 ≤ r < n.
  Lean includes zero among the natural numbers, so we explicitly require
  n > 0. The conclusion also holds when m = 0.

  Proof: Consider all nonnegative integers r for which m = n * q + r
  for some integer q. This collection is nonempty: q = 0 and r = m
  satisfy the equation. Choose its least member r by well-ordering,
  and choose an integer q giving the equation.

  If r ≥ n, then r - n is nonnegative and

    m = n * q + r = n * (q + 1) + (r - n).

  Thus r - n is another member of the collection. Since n > 0,
  it is smaller than r, contradicting the choice of r. Hence r < n.
  The chosen q and r have all the required properties. QED
