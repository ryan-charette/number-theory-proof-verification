We work with natural numbers, treating primes as numbers greater than one.
A factorization is a finite list of primes. Repeated entries record powers:
the number of occurrences of a prime is its exponent. We prove existence
by strong induction and uniqueness by matching and cancelling one prime
at a time. The supporting Euclidean argument is included in this file.

  Theorem: A common divisor divides every integer linear combination.
  Proof: Write a = d * u and b = d * v. Then

    a * x + b * y = d * (u * x + v * y).

  The integer u * x + v * y is the required witness. QED

  Theorem: A nonempty collection of natural numbers has a least member.
  Proof: We prove by strong induction on b that if b is a member, the
  collection has a least member. Strong induction allows us to assume
  the assertion for every natural number smaller than b.

  If some member a is smaller than b, the induction hypothesis at a
  gives a least member. If no member is smaller than b, then b itself
  is least. Finally, nonemptiness supplies a member to start with. QED

theorem division_exists (m n : Nat) (hn : 0 < n) :
    ∃ q r : Int, (m : Int) = (n : Int) * q + r ∧ 0 ≤ r ∧ r < (n : Int) := by
  /-
  Theorem: For a natural number m and a positive natural number n,
  there are integers q and r with m = n * q + r and 0 ≤ r < n.
  Lean includes zero among the natural numbers, so we explicitly require
  n > 0. The conclusion also holds when m = 0.

  Proof: Consider all nonnegative integers r for which m = n * q + r
  for some integer q. This collection is nonempty: q = 0 and r = m
  satisfy the equation. Choose its least member r by well-ordering,
  and choose an integer q giving the equation.

  If r ≥ n, then r - n is nonnegative and

    m = n * q + r = n * (q + 1) + (r - n).

  Thus r - n is another member of the collection. Since n > 0,
  it is smaller than r, contradicting the choice of r. Hence r < n.
  The chosen q and r have all the required properties. QED

  Theorem: The Euclidean procedure produces a nonnegative common divisor
  that is an integer linear combination of the two natural numbers.
  Proof: Use strong induction on the second number b.

  If b = 0, take d = a and coefficients 1 and 0.
  If b > 0, write a = b * q + r with 0 ≤ r < b. Apply the induction
  hypothesis to b and r. It supplies a common divisor d and integers
  x and y with b * x + r * y = d. The preceding common-divisor theorem
  shows that d also divides a. Back-substitution gives

    d = b * x + (a - b * q) * y = a * y + b * (x - q * y).

  These are the required new coefficients. The smaller nonnegative
  remainder ensures that the procedure terminates. QED

  Theorem: A nonprime number greater than one is a product of two
  numbers strictly between one and itself.
  Proof: Since n is not prime, it has a divisor a other than one and n.
  Write n=a*b. Neither factor is zero. The factor b cannot be one,
  since that would give a=n. Both factors are therefore at least two.
  Each divides n and is at most n; equality would force the other
  factor to be one. Thus both factors are strictly smaller than n. QED
