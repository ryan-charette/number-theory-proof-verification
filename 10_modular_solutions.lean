  Theorem: A common divisor divides every integer linear combination.

  Theorem: A nonempty collection of natural numbers has a least member.
  Proof: We prove by strong induction on b that if b is a member, the
  collection has a least member. Strong induction allows us to assume
  the assertion for every natural number smaller than b.

  If some member a is smaller than b, the induction hypothesis at a
  gives a least member. If no member is smaller than b, then b itself
  is least. Finally, nonemptiness supplies a member to start with. QED

theorem division_exists (m n : Nat) (hn : 0 < n) :
    ∃ q r : Int, (m : Int) = (n : Int) * q + r ∧ 0 ≤ r ∧ r < (n : Int) := by
  /-
  Theorem: For a natural number m and a positive natural number n,
  there are integers q and r with m = n * q + r and 0 ≤ r < n.
  Lean includes zero among the natural numbers, so we explicitly require
  n > 0. The conclusion also holds when m = 0.

  Proof: Consider all nonnegative integers r for which m = n * q + r
  for some integer q. This collection is nonempty: q = 0 and r = m
  satisfy the equation. Choose its least member r by well-ordering,
  and choose an integer q giving the equation.

  If r ≥ n, then r - n is nonnegative and

    m = n * q + r = n * (q + 1) + (r - n).

  Thus r - n is another member of the collection. Since n > 0,
  it is smaller than r, contradicting the choice of r. Hence r < n.
  The chosen q and r have all the required properties. QED

  Theorem: The Euclidean procedure produces a nonnegative common divisor
  that is an integer linear combination of the two natural numbers.
  Proof: Use strong induction on the second number b.

  If b = 0, take d = a and coefficients 1 and 0.
  If b > 0, write a = b * q + r with 0 ≤ r < b. Apply the induction
  hypothesis to b and r. It supplies a common divisor d and integers
  x and y with b * x + r * y = d. The preceding common-divisor theorem
  shows that d also divides a. Back-substitution gives

    d = b * x + (a - b * q) * y = a * y + b * (x - q * y).

  These are the required new coefficients. The smaller nonnegative
  remainder ensures that the procedure terminates. QED

The Euclidean construction supplies a nonnegative common divisor together
with coefficients. We name that number gcd(a,b). The next proofs verify
that it is the greatest common divisor in the ordinary numerical sense.
We also set gcd(0,0) = 0 through this construction; statements that require
a positive greatest divisor explicitly exclude the pair (0,0).
