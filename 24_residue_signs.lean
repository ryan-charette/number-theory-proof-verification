  the assertion for every natural number smaller than b.

  If some member a is smaller than b, the induction hypothesis at a

  /-
  Theorem: For a natural number m and a positive natural number n,
  there are integers q and r with m = n * q + r and 0 ≤ r < n.
  Lean includes zero among the natural numbers, so we explicitly require
  n > 0. The conclusion also holds when m = 0.

  Proof: Consider all nonnegative integers r for which m = n * q + r
  for some integer q. This collection is nonempty: q = 0 and r = m
  satisfy the equation. Choose its least member r by well-ordering,
  and choose an integer q giving the equation.

  If r ≥ n, then r - n is nonnegative and

    m = n * q + r = n * (q + 1) + (r - n).

  Thus r - n is another member of the collection. Since n > 0,
  it is smaller than r, contradicting the choice of r. Hence r < n.
  The chosen q and r have all the required properties. QED

  Theorem: The Euclidean procedure produces a nonnegative common divisor
  that is an integer linear combination of the two natural numbers.
  Proof: Use strong induction on the second number b.

  If b = 0, take d = a and coefficients 1 and 0.
  If b > 0, write a = b * q + r with 0 ≤ r < b. Apply the induction
  hypothesis to b and r. It supplies a common divisor d and integers
  x and y with b * x + r * y = d. The preceding common-divisor theorem
  shows that d also divides a. Back-substitution gives

    d = b * x + (a - b * q) * y = a * y + b * (x - q * y).

  We allow any integer m, which also covers natural-number dividends.

  quotients are integers, so q + 1 ≤ q'. Multiplying by positive n,

  Lemma: The canonical label is less than n and represents its input.

  It is nonnegative, so conversion to a natural number preserves its

  Lemma: Multiplication by a coprime integer rearranges the nonzero

  Theorem: For a prime p and an integer a relatively prime to p,
  a^(p-1) is congruent to one modulo p.
  Proof: Let P be the product of the positive integers below p.
  The residue product theorem gives a^(p-1)*P congruent to P,
  because scaling each of its p-1 factors extracts a^(p-1).
  Each factor of P is coprime to p, hence so is P. Cancelling P
